# SummaryAndCompilation
 
This is a library of knowledge that summarizes and compiles some of the knowledge I know or have researched. 

Today, when the Internet is so developed, there is still a lot of knowledge that cannot be searched, except for those confidential, non-commercial, and private, but even some very ordinary and ordinary knowledge has not been sorted and shared, whether it is people's limited energy, or those contents are too remote in the field. But someone has to be able to step up and sort it out.

My energy is also limited, and I can only share some knowledge that I am interested in, or some knowledge that I need in my life and work, of course, these sharing need to be based on my time abundant, so the time for updating and sharing is not fixed.

这是一个关于我所了解或者研究过的一些知识的总结与汇编的知识图书馆。

互联网如此发达的今天，仍旧有许多知识是搜索不到的，除了那些机密性的、非商用的、私人的，但就连一些很普通平常的知识却也没人整理与分享，不论是人的精力有限，还是那些内容所涉及的领域太过偏僻。但总要有人能够站出来去整理的。

我的精力也有限，也只能分享一些我所感兴趣的知识整理，或者是我生活与工作中所需要的某些知识的整理，当然，这些分享都需要建立在我的时间充裕的情况下，因此，更新和分享的时间是不固定的。
