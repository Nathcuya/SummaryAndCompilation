# Mythology And Folklore

**EN**

**As the title can see, this branch library is about some compilation and sharing of myths, legends and folklore from countries around the world.**

As we all know, there have been countless myths and legends in civilizations around the world, and even many have been submerged in the long river of history, and there are many mythological systems that do not exist in isolation, they may be influenced by surrounding civilizations, so as to modify local myths to suit local conditions.

There is even more than one mythological system in some civilizations, which tends to appear in civilizations with a long history and prosperous culture.

Some civilizations in the mythological system is guided by religion, some are compiled and summarized by folklore, some mythological systems serve religion, some serve the government, but they all have one thing in common, these two situations are nothing more than politics, the birth of the mythological system often means faith, and faith means the sustenance and destination of the heart, mastering the faith of the people, and controlling the mind to a certain extent.

But we don't consider the stories behind these various mythological systems, this knowledge base only collates and summarizes.

But after such a long time, many myths themselves have gradually faded into people's vision, and myths are not static, some of these legends are passed down by word of mouth, and some are poorly written and cannot distinguish their true face.

In the long-term evolution, several relatively clear mythological systems have been derived from countries around the world, among which the more famous ones are **Norse mythology**, **Greek-Roman mythology**, **Celtic mythology**, **Slavic mythology**, **Judeo-Christian mythology**, **Chinese mythology**, **Japanese mythology**, **ancient Indian mythology**, **Egyptian mythology**, **Mesopotamian mythology**, **Mesoamerican mythology** and so on.

Some of these mythological systems also include several different myths.

If it is covered and organized later, it will be supplemented in this document.

**Therefore, this library record can be used as a reference, not a rigorous study. I hope readers will know.**

**如题所见，这个分支库是关于世界各国的神话传说与民俗的一些整理与分享。**

众所周知，曾在世界各地的文明中出现过的神话传说数不胜数，甚至有很多都已经淹没在了历史长河中，还有许多的神话体系并不是孤立存在的，它们可能会受到周边文明的影响，从而对本土神话进行修改，以适应本地的国情。

有的文明中甚至不止存在一种神话体系，这往往出现在历史悠久，文化繁荣的文明中。

有的文明中的神话体系由宗教所引导，有的则是由民间传说编纂汇总而来，有的神话体系服务于宗教，有的则服务于政府，但是它们都有一个共同点，这两种情况无外乎于政治，神话体系的诞生往往意味着信仰，而信仰则意味着心灵的寄托与归宿，掌握了民众的信仰，也就在一定程度上控制了思想。

但我们不考虑这些形形色色的神话体系背后的故事，这个知识库只做整理与汇总。

但历经如此长的时间，很多神话本身就已经逐渐淡化在人们的视野中了，而且，神话并非一成不变，这些传说有的口口相传，有的文字记录模糊不清，并不能辨别它们的真实面目。

**所以本库记录可做参考，而并非严谨的考究。望众读者知晓。**

在长久的演变中，世界各国衍生出几个相对明确的神话体系，其中比较著名的有**北欧神话体系**、**希腊-罗马神话体系**、**凯尔特神话体系**、**斯拉夫神话体系**、**犹太-基督神话体系**、**中国神话体系**、**日本神话体系**、**古印度神话体系**、**埃及神话体系**、**美索不达米亚神话体系**、**中美洲神话体系**等等。

而其中某些神话体系还包括了几种不同的神话。

在之后有所涉及与整理的话，将会在本文件中补充说明。
