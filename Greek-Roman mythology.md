# 神话体系介绍

首先，我会在此介绍关于希腊与罗马神话体系。

## **希腊神话**

正如有句话所说：**“辉煌属于希腊，伟大属于罗马”**，希腊文明是西方文化的起源，是最具影响力文明中的一个。
希腊文明的神话诞生于原始氏族阶段。它是古希腊人所创造的一份丰富多彩且宝贵无比的民间文学宝藏。

希腊神话的发展历经了几百年的时间，恩格斯的《家庭、私有制和国家的起源》一书中曾提到：
> 从古代雅利安人的传统的对自然的崇拜而来的全部希腊神话，其发展本身，实质上也是有氏族及胞族所制约并在它们内部进行的。

因此，希腊神话也反映了希腊氏族社会各个不同发展阶段。

正因为这个特点，希腊神话中不仅有神祇，还有被奉为神的人、英和半神。

他们是这些氏族向前发展的生活经验和抗争经验，作为氏族部落光荣业绩的象征。

# Introduction to Mythical Systems

First, I will introduce the mythological systems of Greece and Rome.

## **Greek Mythology**

As the saying goes, **"Glory belongs to Greece, greatness belongs to Rome"**, Greek civilization is the origin of Western culture and one of the most influential civilizations.
The mythology of Greek civilization originated during the primitive tribal stage. It is a rich and invaluable treasure of folk literature created by the ancient Greeks.

The development of Greek mythology spanned hundreds of years, as mentioned in Engels' *The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State*:
> All of Greek mythology, which comes from the ancient Aryan people's traditional worship of nature, its development itself, is essentially restricted and conducted within clans and tribes.

Therefore, Greek mythology also reflects the various developmental stages of Greek tribal society.

Because of this feature, Greek mythology has not only gods, but also gods, heroes and demigods who are worshipped as gods.

They are the life experience and struggle experience of these clans moving forward, as a symbol of the glorious achievements of the clan tribe.
